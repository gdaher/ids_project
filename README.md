I want to learn more about the US jobs market, specifically in the analytics space. I found a dataset scraped from Monster.com that consists of job postings and information about them including title, industry sector, job type (fulltime/temp), salary, and location. There are 22,000 job postings in the dataset, and about 800 analyst positions. I would like to address two questions to start:
    
1. Can you use sector and location to predict analyst salary range?(using logistic regression)
2. Given your location and position type(part-time, temp, etc), is it possible to predict which type of sector has the most jobs? (linear regression)
