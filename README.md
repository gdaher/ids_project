I want to learn more about the US jobs market, specifically in the analytics space. I found a dataset scraped from Monster.com that consists of job postings and information about them including title, industry sector, job type (fulltime/temp), salary, and location. There are 22,000 job postings in the dataset, and about 800 analyst positions. There were not enough analyst positions to build a credible model. So I used all the data in the set to make a linear regression model that uses sector and location to predict salary.
